The font imitates the runway number characters as defined in ICAO Annex 14. This includes following glyphs:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 C L R
```

For latin alphabets, this includes only capital L, C and R. They are parallel runways. 

Kerning is also based on ICAO Annex 14.

The original design source: *Figure 5-3 (Form and proportions of numbers and letters for runway designation markings)* in *ICAO Annex 14 - Aerodromes*

The font imitates *MANDATORY INSTRUCTION MARKINGS* in ICAO Annex 14.

This includes following glyphs.

```
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - /
```

Also this includes some Roman numerals for ILS Catrgory. However, they are currently assigned to different character codes due to the restriction of the software. This problem is going to be fixed in the future version.

```
Ⅰ as ! (Shift + 1)
Ⅱ as @ (Shift + 2)
Ⅲ as # (Shift + 3)
```

This font doesn't includes Latin Small alphabets but these characters have "space" (blank) glyph to avoid switching fonts in Illustrator and so on.

### (WIP) Open Taxiway Guidance Sign

The font imitates *TAXIING GUIDANCE SIGNS* in ICAO Annex 14.

This will be released in near future. Stay tune!
